# Interactive_Charts_With_Plotly_Express
We will create interactive charts with plotly express

Plotly Express is a new high-level Python visualization library: itâ€™s a wrapper for Plotly.py that exposes a simple syntax for complex charts. Inspired by Seaborn and ggplot2, it was specifically designed to have a terse, consistent and easy-to-learn API.

We will plot three graphs here:
  1. Interactive plot that changes size (zooms in) for better view
  2. Chlorpleth map that changes chronologically
  3. Bubble Map that changes chronologically
